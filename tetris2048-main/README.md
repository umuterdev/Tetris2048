Tetris 2048

A unique and engaging twist on the classic Tetris and 2048 games! In Tetris 2048, numbered blocks descend in Tetris-style formations, and your goal is to combine them to form higher numbers and prevent the board from filling up.

Features

Classic Tetris gameplay: Control falling blocks to build complete lines.
2048 merging mechanics: Combine identical blocks to form higher-numbered blocks and clear space.
Strategic challenge: Balance block placement and merging tiles to maximize your score.

How To Play

Use arrow keys to move blocks left, right, and down.
Use a designated key to rotate blocks (if applicable).
Identical blocks touching each other will merge, doubling their number.
Continue filling and merging blocks to clear lines and earn points.
The game ends when the board fills up and you can no longer place blocks.
